# uAPIDocViewer

######An enhanced simple elegant uAPI Doc Viewer
 
Having found the default schema UI of uAPI documentation difficult, I wanted to create my own easy flexible viewer out of passion. Feel free to check the output [here](http://apps.binkith.com/uAPIDocViewer)

You can browse the sample URLs or you can enter any schema url see the modified UI.

There are three UI modes available as of now

1. Table (default)
2. Ul Li list
3. Chart (Jquery org chart)

Contributions are welcome. Ping me at hello@binkith.com for further communication.
